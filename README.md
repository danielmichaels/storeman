> Storeman looks after the contents of your storage. Don't trust marker pens to remember what's in
that box on the shelf.

## Overview

Storeman tracks what actually lives in your storage containers. It leverages printable QR codes, 
sticky tape, Golang and a few forms to keep your things in order. Storeman is designed to be 
self-hosted.
